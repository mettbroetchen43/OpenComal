Basically, too much to start documenting here.... :-)

But, what about:

- Remove internal reliance on chr$(0) as end-of-string
- A Windowing interface (that supports X and Win32, maybe WxWindows? Or 
  Qt?)
- We could do with some comments in the source tree... :-)
- A better SAVEd file format that can withstand some changes in the 
  internal format
- A rewrite in C++ (has been long on my mind)
- Internationalisation of messages (GNU Gettext?)
- Fix the dependencies in the Makefile (makedepend)
- Heavily recursive Comal programs mess up the interpreter a bit. Maybe 
  it's a good idea to rewrite a bit of the cental interpreter to not
  recurse into itself too much. Or keep track of the stack size and
  pose a limit on the heap size the interpreter can allocate.
