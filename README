Thou art looking at the README file of OpenComal. Before you continue, 
thank you very much for downloading my software and taking the time to 
investigate it. Your interest and feedback is much appreciated...

OpenComal is a free implementation of the Comal programming language. 
For more information on (Open)Comal, check out the high quality 
documentation in the doc/ subdirectory... :-)

This release of OpenComal has been built and tested on the Linux 
operating system. OpenComal is very much platform independent, but for 
each platform a special "glue" module must be written. I am currently 
doing most of my work and development on Linux, hence the Linux bias in 
OpenComal 0.2. I do have glue modules for MsDos (16 bit :-), SunOS, 
FreeBSD and HP-UX, but they are not distributed with this release 
because they need some work.

The OpenComal package is covered by the GNU General Public License. 
You can find a copy of that license in the doc/LICENSE file.

For more potential interesting information on OpenComal, please check 
out my OpenComal page at http://www.josvisser.nl/opencomal.

After reading this README, why not read:

	doc/QUICKSTART
	doc/BUILD
	doc/OpenComal.txt

Thanks again for your interest.
